      1. Write requirements in bullet lists and refer to them precisely in your prompts.
      2. Quickly iterate: after each change, run builds/tests to reinforce success or failure.
      3. Maintain a fast test suite and strong TypeScript checks to give clear signals to the AI.
      4. Update or create new rules whenever you correct the AI or adopt new conventions.
      5. Keep code style consistent (ESLint, Prettier, etc.) so the AI sees uniform examples.
      6. For Next.js, prefer server components and the new app directory in version 15. Check code compiles before moving on.
examples:
  - input: "Implement new feature without referencing any tests or instructions"
    output: "Prompt with clarifications and bullet-point requirements, then run tests."
